Fun project for retreats which need question, gratitude, and botheration baskets!

To setup Google spreadsheet scripts, I copied and modified:
Medium's @dmccoy's sheets tutorial scripts: https://medium.com/@dmccoy/how-to-submit-an-html-form-to-google-sheets-without-google-forms-b833952cc175
(They did not come with a license, so assuming this is OK to use)

I have included a modified version of this script in "script" file
This script needs to go be pasted into script section of google spreadsheet you want the questions and gratitudes to go to. Go to publish, deploy as web app. You'll need to allow anonymous/anyone to access in the permissions and give authorizations. The website URL you get back can then be used to submit questions/gratitudes.

Many, many SO, w3, and tutorial posts used in quickly building this. I took code from these Q&A/tutorials and modified/used it (did not copy code from any existing projects/pages, only tutorials, guides, Q&A, etc). Some I have specifically mentioned in the code itself, others that I still have in my history am including here to give credit to. The landing page code/CSS is also from tutorial, can't seem to find it. Included those I had in my history, likely missing some here. See the document "credits.txt" for a list of these sites...
